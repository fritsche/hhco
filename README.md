# HH-CO

This program mainly implements the HH-CO algorithm, described in our paper:

Gian Fritsche and Aurora Pozo. 2019. Cooperative based Hyper-heuristic for Many-objective Optimization. In Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO ’19), July 13–17, 2019, Prague, Czech Republic.ACM, New York, NY, USA, 9 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3321707.3321740

The code was written in Java and based on the jMetal framework. 
Some algorithms were taken from jMetal (https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal);
others from Dr. Yuan Yuan repository (https://github.com/yyxhdy/ManyEAs) or by e-mail.
